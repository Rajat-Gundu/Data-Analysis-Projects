# Rajat Gundu - Data Analysis Portfolio

## About

Hi there! I'm a data enthusist with skills in Power BI, SQL, Python and Excel for Data Analysis. I had the privilege of working at Infosys, where I honed my skills in data engineering and analysis. I'm proficient in SQL for querying databases and performing data manipulation tasks. In addition, I have experience using Python(Pandas,Numpy) for data analysis. I also have knowledge of Hive - HQL, Spark, and Pyspark. I developed these skills during my time as a data engineer at Infosys.
If you're looking for someone with a passion for data and a strong technical skill set, Feel free to reach out!
